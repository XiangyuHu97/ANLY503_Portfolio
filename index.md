## Assignment 5
In assignment 5, we mainly use the data in last assignment to create analysis and visualizations that answer the posed questions:

"Explore all accounts. Create visualizations that combine or these account characteristics:
 
 Whether an account has a credit card or not
 
 Whether an account has a loan or not
 
 The average balance for the account
 
 What is the distribution of all loans and what are their characteristics?
 
 Is there a relationship between a good or bad loan and the time between an account is opened an the loan is created? Is there a specific set of accounts that seem to be at     higher or lower risk of defaulting?
 
 For the account with the highest number of transactions, make a time series line plot for the behavior of the account over time, including all debits and credits, the different methods, and the with the different categories.

Explore the validity of the data for the case whether or not an account has a credit card and whether or not they have associated credit card transactions. Is there anything worth noting?"

For each question, I created some visualizations, and please click if you are interested.
